# MemoryArt
MemoryArt is a fun program written with Qt.
It allocates QImages in different resolutions and with different QImage formats. However, the images are not initialized, so that random data from the memory is interpreted as a QImage.

Be curious to see what you can discover. From interesting shapes and patterns to almost readable characters and text. It's better than fireworks on New Year's Eve. ðŸŽ† Believe me!

Thanks to @pietr26 for the inspiration!
